# Optimal Control

This is a collection of different dynamical system described as differential equations and transformed into state space representations.
LQR, LQG and MPC has been used in this project. Feel free to download and study the examples and learn how to build the models of the physical systems.

# Working Example - Motor Posotion
This is an example how every example is structured. First model, then code, then simulation.
